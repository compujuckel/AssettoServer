# RandomWeatherPlugin
Plugin that changes weather randomly.

**Important:** For smooth weather transitions and rain you need to set `EnableWeatherFx` to `true` in `extra_cfg.yml`.
## Configuration
Enable the plugin in `extra_cfg.yml`
```yaml
EnablePlugins:
- RandomWeatherPlugin
```

Example configuration (add to bottom of `extra_cfg.yml`)  
For a list of weather types that can be used with `WeatherWeights` see [WeatherFX Types](https://assettoserver.org/docs/misc/wfx-types)
```yaml
